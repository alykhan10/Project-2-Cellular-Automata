# Project: Cellular Automata
# Manipulating Infectious Dynamics of Cancer using Modular Programming

● Simulated interplay of cancerous lesions and immune response based on the 'Game of Life' Theory in Java                 
● Propagated 4 different cell types; cancer cells, tissue cells, white blood cells and dead cells, by class inheritance           
● Executed the model stochastically, via polymorphism and cellular automata, to gain insights for cancer diagnostics
